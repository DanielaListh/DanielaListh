Greetings, I'm @DanielaLiseth. 
🦀 Currently, I'm a student of the Technical career in Software Development in Argentina. 
🍓 I'm interested in learning backend programming languages, specifically OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) like C# and the .NET platform.
🍰 I continue to look for projects that provide experience for my personal and educational development, because that keeps me focused and happy.📕
